zt-bcc 0.10.0 alpha 5:
* Updated zcommon.bcs to the latest Zandronum 3.2 functions and definitions.
* Added `module` as one of the address spaces you can specify for pointers, which is normally the default without `#pragma pointer_space`.
* Added `memcmp` to libbcs, works much like C `memcmp.` Useful for raw structure/array comparisons.
* Inlined and optimized all code for the printf-like functions in libbcs, should be faster now.
* libbcs map template definition now takes a compare function for keys. Current options are `LIBBCS_SIMPLE_CMP` and `LIBBCS_STRING_CMP`.
* Numerous fixes to the map template in libbcs, should work reliably now.
* Inline ASM lines must now end in semicolons rather than line breaks.
* Non-private reference initialization warning should only occur for module references now.
* Fixed code for accessing world/global references instead generating instructions for accessing module storage in some cases.
* Fixed reference type checking. Again.
